See
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/" target="_top">https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/</a> for more information about
the big picture. D-Bus is first a library that provides one-to-one
communication between any two applications; <span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span> is an
application that uses this library to implement a message bus
daemon. Multiple programs connect to the message bus daemon and can
exchange messages with one another.</p><p>There are two standard message bus instances: the systemwide message bus
(installed on many systems as the "messagebus" init service) and the
per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in).
<span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span> is used for both of these instances, but with
a different configuration file.</p><p>The --session option is equivalent to
"--config-file=/usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf" and the --system
option is equivalent to
"--config-file=/usr/share/dbus-1/system.conf". By creating
additional configuration files and using the --config-file option,
additional special-purpose message bus daemons could be created.</p><p>The systemwide daemon is normally launched by an init script,
standardly called simply "messagebus".</p><p>The systemwide daemon is largely used for broadcasting system events,
such as changes to the printer queue, or adding/removing devices.</p><p>The per-session daemon is used for various interprocess communication
among desktop applications (however, it is not tied to X or the GUI
in any way).</p><p>SIGHUP will cause the D-Bus daemon to PARTIALLY reload its
configuration file and to flush its user/group information caches. Some
configuration changes would require kicking all apps off the bus; so they will
only take effect if you restart the daemon. Policy changes should take effect
with SIGHUP.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="options"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><p>The following options are supported:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">--config-file=FILE</code></span></dt><dd><p>Use the given configuration file.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">--fork</code></span></dt><dd><p>Force the message bus to fork and become a daemon, even if

        for an event object, in the format printed by the <code class="function">printf</code>
        format string <code class="literal">%p</code>. The parent process must create this event
        object (for example with the <code class="function">CreateEvent</code> function) in a
        nonsignaled state, then configure it to be inherited by the dbus-daemon process.
        The dbus-daemon will signal the event as if via <code class="function">SetEvent</code>
        when it is ready to receive connections from clients. The parent process can
        wait for this to occur by using functions such as
        <code class="function">WaitForSingleObject</code>.
        This option is only supported under Windows. On Unix platforms,
        a similar result can be achieved by waiting for the address and/or
        process ID to be printed to the inherited file descriptors used
        for <code class="option">--print-address</code> and/or <code class="option">--print-pid</code>.
      </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="configuration_file"></a><h2>CONFIGURATION FILE</h2><p>A message bus daemon has a configuration file that specializes it
for a particular application. For example, one configuration
file might set up the message bus to be a systemwide message bus,
while another might set it up to be a per-user-login-session bus.</p><p>The configuration file also establishes resource limits, security
parameters, and so forth.</p><p>The configuration file is not part of any interoperability
specification and its backward compatibility is not guaranteed; this
document is documentation, not specification.</p><p>The standard systemwide and per-session message bus setups are
configured in the files "/usr/share/dbus-1/system.conf" and
"/usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf".  These files normally
&lt;include&gt; a system-local.conf or session-local.conf in
/etc/dbus-1; you can put local
overrides in those files to avoid modifying the primary configuration
files.</p><p>The standard system bus normally reads additional XML files from
  <code class="filename">/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d</code>. Third-party
  packages should install the default policies necessary for correct
  operation into that directory, which has been supported since dbus 1.10
  (released in 2015).</p><p>The standard system bus normally also reads XML files from
  <code class="filename">/etc/dbus-1/system.d</code>, which
  should be used by system administrators if they wish to override
  default policies.</p><p>Third-party packages would historically install XML files into
  <code class="filename">/etc/dbus-1/system.d</code>, but this
  practice is now considered to be deprecated: that directory should
  be treated as reserved for the system administrator.</p><p>The configuration file is an XML document. It must have the following
doctype declaration:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
<br>
   &lt;!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC "-//freedesktop//DTD D-Bus Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"<br>
    "<a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd" target="_top">http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd</a>"&gt;<br>
<br>
</p></div><p>The following elements may be present in the configuration file.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;busconfig&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Root element.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;type&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>The well-known type of the message bus. Currently known values are
"system" and "session"; if other values are set, they should be
either added to the D-Bus specification, or namespaced.  The last
&lt;type&gt; element "wins" (previous values are ignored). This element
only controls which message bus specific environment variables are
set in activated clients.  Most of the policy that distinguishes a
session bus from the system bus is controlled from the other elements
in the configuration file.</p><p>If the well-known type of the message bus is "session", then the
DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE environment variable will be set to "session"
and the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable will be set
to the address of the session bus.  Likewise, if the type of the
message bus is "system", then the DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE environment
variable will be set to "system" and the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS
environment variable will be set to the address of the system bus
(which is normally well known anyway).</p><p>Example: &lt;type&gt;session&lt;/type&gt;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;include&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Include a file &lt;include&gt;filename.conf&lt;/include&gt; at this point.  If the
filename is relative, it is located relative to the configuration file
doing the including.</p><p>&lt;include&gt; has an optional attribute "ignore_missing=(yes|no)"
which defaults to "no" if not provided. This attribute
controls whether it's a fatal error for the included file
to be absent.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;includedir&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Include all files in &lt;includedir&gt;foo.d&lt;/includedir&gt; at this
point. Files in the directory are included in undefined order.
Only files ending in ".conf" are included.</p><p>This is intended to allow extension of the system bus by particular
packages. For example, if CUPS wants to be able to send out
notification of printer queue changes, it could install a file to
/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d that allowed all apps to receive
this message and allowed the printer daemon user to send it.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;user&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>The user account the daemon should run as, as either a username or a
UID. If the daemon cannot change to this UID on startup, it will exit.
If this element is not present, the daemon will not change or care
about its UID.</p><p>The last &lt;user&gt; entry in the file "wins", the others are ignored.</p><p>The user is changed after the bus has completed initialization.  So
sockets etc. will be created before changing user, but no data will be
read from clients before changing user. This means that sockets
and PID files can be created in a location that requires root
privileges for writing.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;fork&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>If present, the bus daemon becomes a real daemon (forks

mechanism will be authorized to connect. This option has no practical
effect unless the ANONYMOUS mechanism has also been enabled using the
<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;auth&gt;</em></span> element, described below.</p><p>Using this directive in the configuration of the well-known
  system bus or the well-known session bus will make that bus insecure
  and should never be done. Similarly, on custom bus types, using this
  directive will usually make the custom bus insecure, unless its
  configuration has been specifically designed to prevent anonymous
  users from causing damage or escalating privileges.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;listen&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Add an address that the bus should listen on. The
address is in the standard D-Bus format that contains
a transport name plus possible parameters/options.</p><p>On platforms other than Windows, <code class="literal">unix</code>-based
  transports (<code class="literal">unix</code>, <code class="literal">systemd</code>,
  <code class="literal">launchd</code>) are the default for both the well-known
  system bus and the well-known session bus, and are strongly
  recommended.</p><p>
  On Windows, <code class="literal">unix</code>-based transports are not available,
  so TCP-based transports must be used.
  Similar to remote X11, the <code class="literal">tcp</code> and
  <code class="literal">nonce-tcp</code> transports have no integrity or
  confidentiality protection, so they should normally only be
  used across the local loopback interface, for example using an
  address like <code class="literal">tcp:host=127.0.0.1</code> or
  <code class="literal">nonce-tcp:host=localhost</code>. In particular,
  configuring the well-known system bus or the well-known session
  bus to listen on a non-loopback TCP address is insecure.
</p><p>
  Developers are sometimes tempted to use remote TCP as a debugging
  tool. However, if this functionality is left enabled in finished
  products, the result will be dangerously insecure. Instead of
  using remote TCP, developers should <a class="ulink" href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2018-April/017447.html" target="_top">relay connections via Secure Shell or a similar protocol</a>.
  
</p><p>
  Remote TCP connections were historically sometimes used to share
  a single session bus between login sessions of the same user on
  different machines within a trusted local area network, in
  conjunction with unencrypted remote X11, a NFS-shared home
  directory and NIS (YP) authentication. This is insecure against
  an attacker on the same LAN and should be considered strongly
  deprecated; more specifically, it is insecure in the same ways
  and for the same reasons as unencrypted remote X11 and NFSv2/NFSv3.
  The D-Bus maintainers
  recommend using a separate session bus per (user, machine) pair,
  only accessible from within that machine.
</p><p>Example: &lt;listen&gt;unix:path=/tmp/foo&lt;/listen&gt;</p><p>Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=1234&lt;/listen&gt;</p><p>If there are multiple &lt;listen&gt; elements, then the bus listens
on multiple addresses. The bus will pass its address to
started services or other interested parties with
the last address given in &lt;listen&gt; first. That is,
apps will try to connect to the last &lt;listen&gt; address first.</p><p>tcp sockets can accept IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses or hostnames.
If a hostname resolves to multiple addresses, the server will bind
to all of them. The family=ipv4 or family=ipv6 options can be used
to force it to bind to a subset of addresses</p><p>Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=0,family=ipv4&lt;/listen&gt;</p><p>A special case is using a port number of zero (or omitting the port),
which means to choose an available port selected by the operating
system. The port number chosen can be obtained with the
--print-address command line parameter and will be present in other
cases where the server reports its own address, such as when
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set.</p><p>Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=0&lt;/listen&gt;</p><p>tcp/nonce-tcp addresses also allow a bind=hostname option,
used in a listenable address to configure the interface on which
the server will listen: either the hostname is the IP address of
one of the local machine's interfaces (most commonly 127.0.0.1),
a DNS name that resolves to one of those IP addresses, '0.0.0.0'
to listen on all IPv4 interfaces simultaneously, or '::'
to listen on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces simultaneously (if supported
by the OS).  If not specified,
the default is the same value as "host".</p><p>Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,bind=0.0.0.0,port=0&lt;/listen&gt;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;auth&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Lists permitted authorization mechanisms. If this element doesn't
exist, then all known mechanisms are allowed.  If there are multiple
&lt;auth&gt; elements, all the listed mechanisms are allowed.  The order in
which mechanisms are listed is not meaningful.</p><p>On non-Windows operating systems, allowing only the
  <code class="literal">EXTERNAL</code> authentication
  mechanism is strongly recommended. This is the default for the
  well-known system bus and for the well-known session bus.</p><p>Example: &lt;auth&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/auth&gt;</p><p>Example: &lt;auth&gt;DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1&lt;/auth&gt;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;servicedir&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>
  Adds a directory to search for .service files, which tell the
  dbus-daemon how to start a program to provide a particular well-known
  bus name. See the D-Bus Specification for more details about the
  contents of .service files.
</p><p>
  If a particular service is found in more than one &lt;servicedir&gt;,
  the first directory listed in the configuration file takes precedence.
  If two service files providing the same well-known bus name are found
  in the same directory, it is arbitrary which one will be chosen
  (this can only happen if at least one of the service files does not
  have the recommended name, which is its well-known bus name followed
  by ".service").
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;standard_session_servicedirs/&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>
  &lt;standard_session_servicedirs/&gt; requests a standard set of
  session service directories. Its effect is similar to specifying a series
  of &lt;servicedir/&gt; elements for each of the data directories,
  in the order given here.
  It is not exactly equivalent, because there is currently no way
  to disable directory monitoring or enforce strict service file naming
  for a &lt;servicedir/&gt;.
</p><p>
  As with &lt;servicedir/&gt; elements, if a particular service is found
  in more than one service directory, the first directory takes precedence.
  If two service files providing the same well-known bus name are found
  in the same directory, it is arbitrary which one will be chosen
  (this can only happen if at least one of the service files does not
  have the recommended name, which is its well-known bus name followed
  by ".service").
</p><p>
  On Unix, the standard session service directories are:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</em></span>/dbus-1/services,

&lt;allow&gt; and &lt;deny&gt; elements. Policies are normally used with the systemwide bus;
they are analogous to a firewall in that they allow expected traffic
and prevent unexpected traffic.</p><p>
  Currently, the system bus has a default-deny policy for sending method calls
  and owning bus names, and a default-allow policy for receiving messages,
  sending signals, and sending a single success or error reply for each
  method call that does not have the <code class="literal">NO_REPLY</code> flag.
  Sending more than the expected number of replies is not allowed.
</p><p>In general, it is best to keep system services as small, targeted programs which
run in their own process and provide a single bus name.  Then, all that is needed
is an &lt;allow&gt; rule for the "own" permission to let the process claim the bus
name, and a "send_destination" rule to allow traffic from some or all uids to
your service.</p><p>The &lt;policy&gt; element has one of four attributes:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>

   &lt;deny group="enemies"/&gt;<br>
</p></div><p>The &lt;deny&gt; element's attributes determine whether the deny "matches" a
particular action. If it matches, the action is denied (unless later
rules in the config file allow it).</p><p>
  Rules with one or more of the <code class="literal">send_</code>* family of attributes
  are checked in order when a connection attempts to send a message. The last
  rule that matches the message determines whether it may be sent.
  The well-known session bus normally allows sending any message.
  The well-known system bus normally allows sending any signal, selected
  method calls to the <span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span>, and exactly one
  reply to each previously-sent method call (either success or an error).
  Either of these can be overridden by configuration; on the system bus,
  services that will receive method calls must install configuration that
  allows them to do so, usually via rules of the form
  <code class="literal">&lt;policy context="default"&gt;&lt;allow send_destination="&#8230;"/&gt;&lt;policy&gt;</code>.
</p><p>
  Rules with one or more of the <code class="literal">receive_</code>* family of
  attributes, or with the <code class="literal">eavesdrop</code> attribute and no others,
  are checked for each recipient of a message (there might be more than one
  recipient if the message is a broadcast or a connection is eavesdropping).
  The last rule that matches the message determines whether it may be received.
  The well-known session bus normally allows receiving any message, including
  eavesdropping. The well-known system bus normally allows receiving any
  message that was not eavesdropped (any unicast message addressed to the
  recipient, and any broadcast message).
</p><p>
  The <code class="literal">eavesdrop</code>, <code class="literal">min_fds</code> and
  <code class="literal">max_fds</code> attributes are modifiers that can be applied
  to either <code class="literal">send_</code>* or <code class="literal">receive_</code>*
  rules, and are documented below.
</p><p>send_destination and receive_sender rules mean that messages may not be
sent to or received from the *owner* of the given name, not that
they may not be sent *to that name*. That is, if a connection
owns services A, B, C, and sending to A is denied, sending to B or C
will not work either. As a special case,
<code class="literal">send_destination="*"</code> matches any message
(whether it has a destination specified or not), and
<code class="literal">receive_sender="*"</code> similarly matches any message.</p><p>
  A <code class="literal">send_destination_prefix</code> rule opens or closes
  the whole namespace for sending. It means that messages may or may not
  be sent to the <span class="emphasis"><em>owner</em></span> of any name matching the prefix, regardless of whether
  it is the primary or the queued owner.
  In other words, for <code class="literal">&lt;allow send_destination_prefix="a.b"/&gt;</code>
  rule and names "a.b", "a.b.c", and "a.b.c.d" present on the bus, it works the same as
  if three separate rules: <code class="literal">&lt;allow send_destination="a.b"/&gt;</code>,
  <code class="literal">&lt;allow send_destination="a.b.c"/&gt;</code>, and
  <code class="literal">&lt;allow send_destination="a.b.c.d"/&gt;</code> had been defined.
  The rules for matching names are the same as in <code class="literal">own_prefix</code>
  (see below): a prefix of "a.b" matches names "a.b" or "a.b.c" or "a.b.c.d", but not "a.bc"
  or "a.c". The <code class="literal">send_destination_prefix</code> attribute cannot be combined
  with the <code class="literal">send_destination</code> attribute in the same rule.
</p><p>
  Rules with <code class="literal">send_broadcast="true"</code> match signal messages
  with no destination (broadcasts). Rules with
  <code class="literal">send_broadcast="false"</code> are the inverse: they match any
  unicast destination (unicast signals, together with all method calls, replies
  and errors) but do not match messages with no destination (broadcasts). This
  is not the same as <code class="literal">send_destination="*"</code>, which matches any
  sent message, regardless of whether it has a destination or not.
</p><p>
  The other <code class="literal">send_</code>* and <code class="literal">receive_</code>*
  attributes are purely textual/by-value matches against the given field in
  the message header, except that for the attributes where it is allowed,
  <code class="literal">*</code> matches any message (whether it has the relevant
  header field or not). For example, <code class="literal">send_interface="*"</code>
  matches any sent message, even if it does not contain an interface header
  field. More complex glob matching such as <code class="literal">foo.bar.*</code> is
  not allowed.
</p><p>"Eavesdropping" occurs when an application receives a message that
was explicitly addressed to a name the application does not own, or
is a reply to such a message. Eavesdropping thus only applies to
messages that are addressed to services and replies to such messages
(i.e. it does not apply to signals).</p><p>For &lt;allow&gt;, eavesdrop="true" indicates that the rule matches even
when eavesdropping. eavesdrop="false" is the default and means that
the rule only allows messages to go to their specified recipient.
For &lt;deny&gt;, eavesdrop="true" indicates that the rule matches
only when eavesdropping. eavesdrop="false" is the default for &lt;deny&gt;
also, but here it means that the rule applies always, even when
not eavesdropping. The eavesdrop attribute can only be combined with
send and receive rules (with send_* and receive_* attributes).</p><p>The [send|receive]_requested_reply attribute works similarly to the eavesdrop
attribute. It controls whether the &lt;deny&gt; or &lt;allow&gt; matches a reply
that is expected (corresponds to a previous method call message).
This attribute only makes sense for reply messages (errors and method
returns), and is ignored for other message types.</p><p>For &lt;allow&gt;, [send|receive]_requested_reply="true" is the default and indicates that
only requested replies are allowed by the
rule. [send|receive]_requested_reply="false" means that the rule allows any reply
even if unexpected.</p><p>For &lt;deny&gt;, [send|receive]_requested_reply="false" is the default but indicates that
the rule matches only when the reply was not
requested. [send|receive]_requested_reply="true" indicates that the rule applies
always, regardless of pending reply state.</p><p>
  The <code class="literal">min_fds</code> and <code class="literal">max_fds</code> attributes
  modify either <code class="literal">send_</code>* or <code class="literal">receive_</code>*
  rules. A rule with the <code class="literal">min_fds</code> attribute only matches
  messages if they have at least that many Unix file descriptors attached.
  Conversely, a rule with the <code class="literal">max_fds</code> attribute only
  matches messages if they have no more than that many file descriptors
  attached. In practice, rules with these attributes will most commonly
  take the form
  <code class="literal">&lt;allow send_destination="&#8230;" max_fds="0"/&gt;</code>,
  <code class="literal">&lt;deny send_destination="&#8230;" min_fds="1"/&gt;</code> or
  <code class="literal">&lt;deny receive_sender="*" min_fds="1"/&gt;</code>.
</p><p>
  Rules with the <code class="literal">user</code> or <code class="literal">group</code>
  attribute are checked when a new connection to the message bus is
  established, and control whether the connection can continue.
  Each of these attributes cannot be combined with any other
  attribute. As a special case, both <code class="literal">user="*"</code> and
  <code class="literal">group="*"</code> match any connection. If there are
  no rules of this form, the default is to allow connections from the same
  user ID that owns the <span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span> process. The well-known
  session bus normally uses that default behaviour, while the well-known
  system bus normally allows any connection.
</p><p>
  Rules with the <code class="literal">own</code> or <code class="literal">own_prefix</code>
  attribute are checked when a connection attempts to own a well-known bus
  names. As a special case, <code class="literal">own="*"</code> matches any well-known
  bus name. The well-known session bus normally allows any connection to
  own any name, while the well-known system bus normally does not allow any
  connection to own any name, except where allowed by further configuration.
  System services that will own a name must install configuration that allows
  them to do so, usually via rules of the form
  <code class="literal">&lt;policy user="some-system-user"&gt;&lt;allow own="&#8230;"/&gt;&lt;/policy&gt;</code>.
</p><p>&lt;allow own_prefix="a.b"/&gt; allows you to own the name "a.b" or any
name whose first dot-separated elements are "a.b": in particular,
you can own "a.b.c" or "a.b.c.d", but not "a.bc" or "a.c".
This is useful when services like Telepathy and ReserveDevice
define a meaning for subtrees of well-known names, such as
org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ConnectionManager.(anything)
and org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.(anything).</p><p>It does not make sense to deny a user or group inside a &lt;policy&gt;
for a user or group; user/group denials can only be inside
context="default" or context="mandatory" policies.</p><p>A single &lt;deny&gt; rule may specify combinations of attributes such as
send_destination and send_interface and send_type. In this case, the
denial applies only if both attributes match the message being denied.
e.g. &lt;deny send_interface="foo.bar" send_destination="foo.blah"/&gt; would
deny messages with the given interface AND the given bus name.
To get an OR effect you specify multiple &lt;deny&gt; rules.</p><p>You can't include both send_ and receive_ attributes on the same
rule, since "whether the message can be sent" and "whether it can be
received" are evaluated separately.</p><p>Be careful with send_interface/receive_interface, because the
interface field in messages is optional.  In particular, do NOT
specify &lt;deny send_interface="org.foo.Bar"/&gt;!  This will cause
no-interface messages to be blocked for all services, which is
almost certainly not what you intended.  Always use rules of
the form: &lt;deny send_interface="org.foo.Bar" send_destination="org.foo.Service"/&gt;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;selinux&gt;</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>The &lt;selinux&gt; element contains settings related to Security Enhanced Linux.

    The standard system bus does not allow method calls or owning well-known
    bus names by default, so a useful D-Bus system service will normally
    need to configure a default security policy that allows it to work.
    D-Bus system services should install a default policy file in
    <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>${datadir}</code></em>/dbus-1/service.d</code>,
    containing the policy rules necessary to make that system service
    functional. A best-practice policy file will often look like this:

    where <em class="replaceable"><code>_example</code></em> is the username of the
    system uid that will run the system service daemon process, and
    <em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em> is its well-known
    bus name.</p><p>The policy file for <em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em>
    should normally be named
    <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em>.conf</code>.
  </p><p>Some existing system services rely on more complex &lt;policy&gt;
    rules to control the messages that the service can receive. However,
    the <span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span>'s policy language is not well-suited
    to finer-grained policies: any policy has to be expressed in terms of
    D-Bus interfaces and method names, not in terms of higher-level
    domain-specific concepts like removable or built-in devices. It is
    recommended that new services should normally accept method call messages
    from all callers, then apply a sysadmin-controllable policy to decide
    whether to obey the requests contained in those method call messages,
    for example by consulting
    <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/polkit/" target="_top">polkit</a>.
  </p><p>
    Like session services, many D-Bus system services support service
    activation, a mechanism in which the <span class="command"><strong>dbus-daemon</strong></span>
    can launch the service on-demand, either by running the system service
    itself or by communicating with <span class="command"><strong>systemd</strong></span>. This is set
    up by creating a service file in the directory
    <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>${datadir}</code></em>/dbus-1/system-services</code>,
    for example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
[D-BUS Service]
Name=<em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em>
Exec=<em class="replaceable"><code>/usr/sbin/example-service</code></em>
User=<em class="replaceable"><code>_example</code></em>
# Optional
SystemdService=<em class="replaceable"><code>dbus-com.example.Example1.service</code></em>
</pre><p>

    See the
    <a class="ulink" href="https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html" target="_top">D-Bus
      Specification</a> for details of the contents and interpretation
    of service files.</p><p>If there is a service file for
    <em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em>, it must be named
    <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>com.example.Example1</code></em>.service</code>.
  </p><p>System services that declare the optional
    <code class="literal">SystemdService</code> must also provide a systemd
    service unit file whose name or <code class="literal">Alias</code> matches the
    <code class="literal">SystemdService</code> (see
    <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.unit</span>(5)</span>,
    <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.service</span>(5)</span> for further details on systemd service units), for

Some useful excerpts:</p><p>Every subject (process) and object (e.g. file, socket, IPC object,
etc) in the system is assigned a collection of security attributes,
known as a security context. A security context contains all of the
security attributes associated with a particular subject or object
that are relevant to the security policy.</p><p>In order to better encapsulate security contexts and to provide
greater efficiency, the policy enforcement code of SELinux typically
handles security identifiers (SIDs) rather than security contexts. A
SID is an integer that is mapped by the security server to a security
context at runtime.</p><p>When a security decision is required, the policy enforcement code
passes a pair of SIDs (typically the SID of a subject and the SID of
an object, but sometimes a pair of subject SIDs or a pair of object
SIDs), and an object security class to the security server. The object
security class indicates the kind of object, e.g. a process, a regular
file, a directory, a TCP socket, etc.</p><p>Access decisions specify whether or not a permission is granted for a
given pair of SIDs and class. Each object class has a set of
associated permissions defined to control operations on objects with
that class.</p><p>D-Bus performs SELinux security checks in two places.</p><p>First, any time a message is routed from one connection to another
connection, the bus daemon will check permissions with the security context of
the first connection as source, security context of the second connection
as target, object class "dbus" and requested permission "send_msg".</p><p>If a security context is not available for a connection
(impossible when using UNIX domain sockets), then the target
context used is the context of the bus daemon itself.
There is currently no way to change this default, because we're
assuming that only UNIX domain sockets will be used to
connect to the systemwide bus. If this changes, we'll
probably add a way to set the default connection context.</p><p>Second, any time a connection asks to own a name,
the bus daemon will check permissions with the security
context of the connection as source, the security context specified
for the name in the config file as target, object
class "dbus" and requested permission "acquire_svc".</p><p>The security context for a bus name is specified with the
&lt;associate&gt; element described earlier in this document.
If a name has no security context associated in the
configuration file, the security context of the bus daemon
itself will be used.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="apparmor"></a><h2>AppArmor</h2><p>The AppArmor confinement context is stored when applications connect to
the bus. The confinement context consists of a label and a confinement mode.
When a security decision is required, the daemon uses the confinement context
to query the AppArmor policy to determine if the action should be allowed or
denied and if the action should be audited.</p><p>The daemon performs AppArmor security checks in three places.</p><p>First, any time a message is routed from one connection to another
connection, the bus daemon will check permissions with the label of the first
connection as source, label and/or connection name of the second connection as
target, along with the bus name, the path name, the interface name, and the
member name. Reply messages, such as method_return and error messages, are
implicitly allowed if they are in response to a message that has already been
allowed.</p><p>Second, any time a connection asks to own a name, the bus daemon will
check permissions with the label of the connection as source, the requested
name as target, along with the bus name.</p><p>Third, any time a connection attempts to eavesdrop, the bus daemon will
check permissions with the label of the connection as the source, along with
the bus name.</p><p>AppArmor rules for bus mediation are not stored in the bus configuration
files. They are stored in the application's AppArmor profile. Please see
<span class="emphasis"><em>apparmor.d(5)</em></span> for more details.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="debugging"></a><h2>DEBUGGING</h2><p>If you're trying to figure out where your messages are going or why
you aren't getting messages, there are several things you can try.</p><p>Remember that the system bus is heavily locked down and if you
haven't installed a security policy file to allow your message
through, it won't work. For the session bus, this is not a concern.</p><p>The simplest way to figure out what's happening on the bus is to run
the <span class="emphasis"><em>dbus-monitor</em></span> program, which comes with the D-Bus
package. You can also send test messages with <span class="emphasis"><em>dbus-send</em></span>. These
programs have their own man pages.</p><p>If you want to know what the daemon itself is doing, you might consider
running a separate copy of the daemon to test against. This will allow you
to put the daemon under a debugger, or run it with verbose output, without
messing up your real session and system daemons.</p><p>To run a separate test copy of the daemon, for example you might open a terminal
and type:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
  DBUS_VERBOSE=1 dbus-daemon --session --print-address<br>
</p></div><p>The test daemon address will be printed when the daemon starts. You will need
to copy-and-paste this address and use it as the value of the
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable when you launch the applications
you want to test. This will cause those applications to connect to your
test bus instead of the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS of your real session bus.</p><p>DBUS_VERBOSE=1 will have NO EFFECT unless your copy of D-Bus
was compiled with verbose mode enabled. This is not recommended in
production builds due to performance impact. You may need to rebuild
D-Bus if your copy was not built with debugging in mind. (DBUS_VERBOSE
also affects the D-Bus library and thus applications using D-Bus; it may
be useful to see verbose output on both the client side and from the daemon.)</p><p>If you want to get fancy, you can create a custom bus
configuration for your test bus (see the session.conf and system.conf
files that define the two default configurations for example). This
would allow you to specify a different directory for .service files,
for example.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="author"></a><h2>AUTHOR</h2><p>See <a class="ulink" href="https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/AUTHORS" target="_top">https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/AUTHORS</a></p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="bugs"></a><h2>BUGS</h2><p>Please send bug reports to the D-Bus mailing list or bug tracker,
